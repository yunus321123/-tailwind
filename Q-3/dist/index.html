           <strong class="text-lg text-left">His Saga is the entrepreneurial creation myth</strong> writ large: Steve Jobs cofounded Apple in his parents' garage in 1976, was fousted in 1985, returned to rescue it from near bankruptcy in 1997, and by the time he died, in October 2011, hd built it into the world's most valuable company.
            Along the way he helped to transform seven industries: personal computing, animated movies, music,phones,tablet computing,retail stores, and digital publishing. He thus belong in the pantheon of America's great innobators, along with Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Walt Disney. None of these men was a saint, but long after their personalities are gorgotten, history will remember how they applied imagination to technology and business.
